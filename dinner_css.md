##### Reflection:
I learnt that there are many ways to use CSS selectors, and many of them are very convinient to use than to use single CSS selector. However, I also noticed that there are some selectors that were very hard to think, so I think that in real life, sometimes, I shouldn't use them and instead just use the single selector as the process would be faster.
