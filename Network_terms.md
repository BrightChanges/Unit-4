#### Task:
Define the terms:

* IP address: An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

* IP version 4 and version 6: First deployed in 1983 by Advanced Research Projects Agency Networks (ARPANET), IPv4 is still the most used routed protocol, despite its successor IPv6. IPv4 uses a 32-bit (232) address space, meaning that a total of 4,294,967,296 (~4.3 billion) unique IP addresses can be assigned to hosts. Meanwhile, IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 uses 128-bit (2128) addresses, allowing 3.4 x 1038 unique IP addresses. This is equal to 340 trillion trillion trillion IP addresses. Pv6 is written in hexadecimal notation, separated into 8 groups of 16 bits by the colons, thus (8 x 16 = 128) bits in total. 

* SSH: SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. In addition to providing secure network services, SSH refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet. In addition to providing strong encryption, SSH is widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely, enabling them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.

* SCP: The Secure Copy Protocol or “SCP” helps to transfer computer files securely from a local to a remote host. It is somewhat similar to the File Transfer Protocol “FTP”, but it adds security and authentication. The RCP is used to transfer the files, and the SSH protocol provides authentication and encryption, so SCP can be considered a mixture of these two protocols. The data that is being transferred remains confidential, so the SCP can be used to successfully block packet sniffers that can extract valuable information from the data packets.

* Terminal commands: LS, CAT, ECHO, CD
    * LS: ls is a command to list computer files in Unix and Unix-like operating systems (MacOS). ls is specified by POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification. When invoked without any arguments, ls lists the files in the current working directory.
    * CAT: The cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files. The command is available in Linux, Windows Power Shell, and MacOS.
    * ECHO: echo is a command that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments. It is a command available in various operating system shells and typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.
    * CD: The cd (“change directory”) command is used to change the current working directory in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is one of the most basic and frequently used commands when working on the Linux terminal.

* CHMOD: In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, chmod is the command and system call which is used to change the access permissions of file system objects. 

* Server: In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.

* Router: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets.

* Switch: 

* wLAN

* LAN
