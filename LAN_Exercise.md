#### Summary of class's LAN Exercise:
Today, students in my Computer Science class and I set up a LAN (Local Area Network) from a router with a built in modem, a switch, and multiple cables. We first connects the Router/Modem to an eletrical source. After that we connect a cable from it to a switch, which has multiple ports that could let multiple computers connecting with it. While today, our router wasn't connect to the Internet, a router has the capabilities to provide Internet to multiple devices in the network. However, as it has limited amount of ports that let devices connect to it, a switch is needed to connect to the router in order to then bring this Internet from the router to more devices in the network. As the wireless access point in our router didn't work, in order for our devices/computers to connect with the switch and therefore our LAN, we needed to use physical wired cable. Overall, while we couldn't share file yet, we learnt how to set up a LAN.
